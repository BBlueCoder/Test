def reverse(number):
    # This will raise an exception because number is not a string
    # The correct code is : reversed = str(number)[::-1]
    reversed = number[::-1]

    # Since the variable reversed is a string, we need to convert it back to an int
    # return int(reversed)
    return reversed

# Response 1 is better than Response 2 because it moves in the right direction.
# Even though Response 1 contains errors in the code, it understands the requirements of the prompt, and its
# intentions are correct. The response attempts to reverse the number using slicing with a step of -1.
# However, since the parameter is a number and not a string, this will raise an exception.
# Therefore, the number should first be converted to a string, reversed, and then the reversed string should be
# converted back to an integer before returning it. On the other hand, Response 2 is completely incorrect because
# it misunderstands the prompt's request. The prompt asks to reverse the number, not return the opposite value.
# As a result, Response 1 is the better response.
